# Dave Stewart - Gridsome / Wordpress API

> A Gridsome conversion of my portflio site

## Overview

This project is designed to migrate and ultimately replace my WordPress portfolio with a static Gridsome site.

It will be done in two phases:

1. build the shell of the site using the Wordpress API
2. convert all resources to markdown and use the source filesystem
